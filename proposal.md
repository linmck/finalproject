# [Project Title]
Predicting the Human Developent Index 
by Ellen Hsu, Samita Limbu, and Lindsey McKenna

## Project Topic

Can we predict the development trajectory of a country (as measured by HDI) based on the World Development Indicators surveyed by The World Bank?


## Rationale 

We are interested in exploring the Sustainable Development Goals set forth by The World Bank that they would like to achieve by 2030. These goals are measured by several [World Development Indicators](http://datatopics.worldbank.org/world-development-indicators/). We will select several indicators the help predict the development of a country as measured by the [Human Development Index](http://hdr.undp.org/en/data#). The Human Development Index is a comprehensive measure of the development of a country that takes into account factors other than just GDP such as health, education, infrastructure, etc. 


## Data Sets

- [World Development Indicators](http://datatopics.worldbank.org/world-development-indicators/)
- [Human Development Index](http://hdr.undp.org/en/data#)

## Project Stack

What ML algorithms are you considering?
Which libraries, tools, and technology will you use?


## Project Goals

What will your end product be?
Do you any alternative plans if something doesn't go as expected?


## OPTIONAL Work load organization

This is not required but it may be helpful to think through at the beginning of your project. How will you divide up the work? How will you use git to colloborate? How will you prioritize tasks and deliverables? How will you track what needs to be done?
