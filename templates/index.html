      <h3>Our Research</h3>
      <p>For this project we were interested in analyzing the <a
        href="http://datatopics.worldbank.org/world-development-indicators/" target="_blank">World Development Indicators (WDI)</a>
        that have been tracked by the World Bank for more than 50 years in order to help achieve global development goals. 
        In conjunction, the U.N. has developed the <a 
        href="http://hdr.undp.org/en/data#" target="_blank">Human Development Index (HDI)</a> to focus 
        on the criteria that define human achievement beyond just economic development. We wanted to discover which WDIs in 
        particular affect HDI and what level of values can help increase HDI. Our "primary" indicators 
        were simply those that most countries have data for and have been tracked the longest. Our "secondary" indicators are ones
        that we discovered to be highly related to HDI and worth exploring, despite less availability of tracked data.</p>

      <h3>The Machine Learning Models</h3>
      <p>For this project, we used linear and multilinear regression models since HDI was numerical and we had a few features/indicators 
        to consider. During the charting and modelling process we discovered which indicators, such as life expectancy and
        education, weighed on the model much more heavily than others because they had strong linear relationships 
        individually with HDI. For more moderate indicators, the ML model allowed us to create combinations of either 
        known or estimated WDI values to try and reach the highest HDI.</p>

      <h3>Summary Findings</h3>
      <p>Economists often use GDP as the primary measure of a country's achievement or productivity. In our research however, when
        we focused on human development (HDI) as our measure of success, certain indicators came to light as having strong 
        influence on HDI. Surprisingly, GDP and GNI were only moderately relevant to human development; agriculture was inversely 
        related to HDI; and population and employment were not likely related to HDI. While exploring other indicators, 
        we discovered that education, gender equality, and access to basic and technological necessities were heavily relevant to
        HDI. By using a model and exploring the less obvious indicators, we hope to uncover achievable and quantifiable
        measures - besides what has historically been focused on - to improve human 
        development and goal-setting for each country and/or the global community.</p>
